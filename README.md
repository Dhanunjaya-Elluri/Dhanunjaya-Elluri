### About Me

Hello! I'm Dhanunjaya Elluri, a passionate Data Scientist and MLOps engineer with a keen interest in exploring the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am currently working as an MLOps intern at Munich RE, where I am actively involved in developing and deploying machine learning models into production environments.

In addition to my industry experience, I am pursuing my masters in Data Science at TU Dortmund, where I am gaining a deep understanding of various data-driven methodologies and techniques. My academic journey has further fueled my curiosity and motivation to delve into the fascinating world of data science.

My research interests primarily revolve around Time series analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I find the challenges of modeling temporal data and extracting meaningful insights from it particularly intriguing. Furthermore, I am fascinated by the power of language and how NLP techniques can enable us to understand, analyze, and generate human-like text.

At present, I am focused on a thesis project titled ["Time series forecasting using transformers on the tokens generated using Kernel SAX"](https://github.com/Dhanunjaya-Elluri/master-thesis). This research aims to leverage the power of transformer-based architectures to tackle time series forecasting tasks. By combining this approach with Kernel SAX, I intend to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of the predictions. I believe that this research can contribute to the advancement of time series forecasting techniques and provide valuable insights in diverse domains.

On my Github profile, you will find a collection of my projects and contributions that reflect my passion for data science, machine learning, and MLOps. I enjoy collaborating with fellow data enthusiasts and am always eager to learn and share knowledge. Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to ongoing projects, or reach out to me for any exciting opportunities or discussions.

Let's harness the power of data and technology to solve complex problems and shape a better future together!
