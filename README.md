# 💫 About Me:

Hi, I'm Dhanunjaya Elluri, a dedicated Data Scientist and MLOps Engineer with a focus on AI and ML. Currently, I'm an MLOps intern at Munich RE, deploying ML models in production, and a Data Science master's student at TU Dortmund, enhancing my expertise in data-driven methods.

My research is centered on Time Series Analysis and NLP, where I explore the complexities of temporal data and the intricacies of language through technology. My thesis ["Transformers for Quantized Time Series Forecasting"](https://github.com/Dhanunjaya-Elluri/master-thesis) aims to improve forecasting with advanced transformer techniques and Kernel SAX.

Check out my GitHub for projects that showcase my commitment to Data Science, ML, and MLOps. I'm open to collaborations and discussions that push the boundaries of data and tech. Let's connect and drive innovation together!
